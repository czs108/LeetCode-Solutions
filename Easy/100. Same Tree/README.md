# 100. Same Tree

> Easy

------

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

![tree-1](images/tree-1.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![tree-2](images/tree-2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

![tree-3](images/tree-3.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```
