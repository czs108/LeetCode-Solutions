# 257. Binary Tree Paths

> Easy

------

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

![tree](images/tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```
