# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

> Easy

------

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than `1`.

**Example 1:**

![tree-1](images/tree-1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![tree-2](images/tree-2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```
