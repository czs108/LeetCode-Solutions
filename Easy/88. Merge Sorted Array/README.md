# 88. Merge Sorted Array

> Easy

------

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Note that you may assume that `nums1` has enough space to hold additional elements from `nums2`.
