# 1. Two Sum

> Easy

------

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9,
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.
