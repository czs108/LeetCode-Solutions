# 476. Number Complement

> Easy

------

Given a positive integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer's binary representation.
