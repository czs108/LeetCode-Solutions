# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

> Easy

------

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1:**

![list](images/list.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
