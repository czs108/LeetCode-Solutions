# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

> Easy

------

You are given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer `val`.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

**Example 1:**

![tree-1](images/tree-1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![tree-2](images/tree-2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```
