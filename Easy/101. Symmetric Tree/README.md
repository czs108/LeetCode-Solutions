# 101. Symmetric Tree

> Easy

------

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![tree-1](images/tree-1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![tree-2](images/tree-2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```
