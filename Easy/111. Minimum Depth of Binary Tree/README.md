# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

> Easy

------

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

![tree](images/tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```
