# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

> Medium

------

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

**Example 1:**

![list-1](images/list-1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![list-2](images/list-2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```
