# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

> Medium

------

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m Ã— n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example 1:**

![mat-1](images/mat-1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![mat-2](images/mat-2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
```
