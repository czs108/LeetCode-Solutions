# 1048. Longest String Chain

> Medium

------

You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`word_A` is a predecessor of `word_B` if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in `word_A` without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to `word_B`.

- For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`, while `"cba"` is not a predecessor of `"bcad"`.

A word chain is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k â‰¥ 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with `k = 1`.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
