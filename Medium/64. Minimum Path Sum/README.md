# 64. Minimum Path Sum

> Medium

------

Given a `m × n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note that you can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

![grid](images/grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
