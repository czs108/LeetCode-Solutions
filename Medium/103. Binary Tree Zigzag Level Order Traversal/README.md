# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

> Medium

------

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example 1:**

![tree](images/tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
