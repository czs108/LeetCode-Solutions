# 364. Nested List Weight Sum II

> Medium

------

You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list `[1,[2,2],[[3],2],1]` has each integer's value set to its depth. Let `maxDepth` be the maximum depth of any integer.

The weight of an integer is `maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1`.

Return the sum of each integer in `nestedList` multiplied by its weight.

**Example 1:**

![list-1](images/list-1.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Four 1's with a weight of 1, one 2 with a weight of 2.
1*1 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 8
```

**Example 2:**

![list-2](images/list-2.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1.
1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17
```
