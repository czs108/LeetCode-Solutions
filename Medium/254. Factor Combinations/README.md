# 254. Factor Combinations

> Medium

------

Numbers can be regarded as the product of their factors.

- For example, `8 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 2 × 4`.

Given an integer `n`, return all possible combinations of its factors. You may return the answer in any order.

Note that the factors should be in the range `[2, n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 12
Output: [[2,6],[3,4],[2,2,3]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 37
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 32
Output: [[2,16],[4,8],[2,2,8],[2,4,4],[2,2,2,4],[2,2,2,2,2]]
```
