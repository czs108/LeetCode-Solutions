------

You have some coins. The `i`-th coin has a probability `prob[i]` of facing heads when tossed.

Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals `target` if you toss every coin exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
Output: 0.40000
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
Output: 0.03125
