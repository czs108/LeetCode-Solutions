# 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends

> Medium

------

There are `n` people in a social group labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `logs` where `logs[i] = [timestamp_i, x_i, y_i]` indicates that `x_i` and `y_i` will be friends at the time `timestamp_i`.

Friendship is symmetric. That means if `a` is friends with `b`, then `b` is friends with `a`. Also, person `a` is acquainted with a person `b` if `a` is friends with `b`, or `a` is a friend of someone acquainted with `b`.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation:
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friends anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `x_i â‰  y_i`
- All the values `timestamp_i` are unique.
- All the pairs `(x_i, y_i)` occur at most one time in the input.
