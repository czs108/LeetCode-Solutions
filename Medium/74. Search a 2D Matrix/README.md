# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

> Medium

------

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m Ã— n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

![mat-1](images/mat-1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![mat-2](images/mat-2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```
