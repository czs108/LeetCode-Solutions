# 43. Multiply Strings

> Medium

------

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

Note that you must not use any built-in `BigInteger` library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

**Constraints:**

- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
- Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
