    // As long as there is equal number of points to the left and right of the meeting point, the total distance is minimized.
    //
    // Why:
    // For the case: 1-1-0-0-1. The median `x` = 1 is our initial meeting point.
    // Now if we move one step to its right where `x` = 2. Assume that the total distance traveled is `d`.
    // Since there are two points to the left of `x` = 2, we add 2 * (+1) to `d`.
    // And `d` is offset by â€“1 since there is one point to the right.
    // This means the distance had overall increased by 1.
