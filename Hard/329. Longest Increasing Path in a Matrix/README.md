# 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

> Hard

------

Given an `m × n` integers `matrix`, return the length of the longest increasing path in `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**

![mat-1](images/mat-1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```

**Example 2:**

![mat-2](images/mat-2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1
