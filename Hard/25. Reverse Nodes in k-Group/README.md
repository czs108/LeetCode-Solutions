# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

> Hard

------

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time and return its modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![list-1](images/list-1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![list-2](images/list-2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
