The `n`-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n Ã— n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the `n`-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the `n`-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
